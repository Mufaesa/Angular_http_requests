# Angular Http Requests

## The repo

This project is based on the Udemy course: Angular - The Complete Guide (2023 Edition) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

This repository specifically is created to learn about http requests with Angular. The focus of this repo will be on learning the front-end side with Angular. The back-end used to connect to is run on Firebase.

## Things I learned

* Using Firebase as a back-end
* Calling HTTP post
* HTTP calls require an observable to work in Angular
* Piping get output to make data usable
* Defining expected response of HTTP calls
